                        <p> Disney has mastered the art of storytelling by captivating audiences through its narrative for generations. Audiences have adored Disney movies for their love stories, friendships, music, and animation. Nevertheless, Disney is not immune to mistakes as we’ll see today as we go through 10 Times Disney Make HUGE Mistakes.
                        Noticing a small mistake in a movie can really take away from its magical qualities! “The Emperor’s New Groove” has its setting mixed up while “The Lion King” didn’t do the best research when it came to Africa’s biodiversity. Turns out “Hercules” is much more fiction than myth! Meanwhile, “Frozen” includes an appearing sword with no explanation, Cinderella has a secret outfit change, and Aladdin is missing body parts! Some of our favorite Disney movies have mistakes that are impossible to ignore once you know about them! Watch until the end to see why several mistakes are offensive in “Pocahontas.”</p>

                        <h3 itemprop="name">10 Disney Princess Connections That Will Make Your Jaw Drop</h3>
                        <p>We all know that Disney likes to give us connections to their other films, and when watching them we like to look to for them, so today at Screen Rant, we’re taking a look at ten Disney Princess connections that you wouldn’t expect. </p>
                        <p>We take a look at how Disney re-used idea’s that had been in the initial drafts of Snow White in Sleeping Beauty almost a decade later, such as the prince having to face off against the witch. And on the subject of Snow White, we take a look at the theory that Tangled’s Mother Gothel is actually the Evil Queen.</p>
                        <p>Disney also like connecting their films via storybooks, with both Beauty and the Beast and The Princess and the Frog using storybooks to show what film was coming next, which were Aladdin and Tangled, and how Tangled features a few past gems in the books on the floor.</p>
                        <p>As well as books, other objects are used to make connections. The Magic Carpet from Aladdin is found in a few other films, including The Princess and the Frog, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Moana. Also, had you ever noticed that the only princesses to wear gloves are those who married into royalty.</p>
                        <p>We also get into the big one, about how Rapunzel, Elsa and Anna are actually cousins, and about how their parents died on the way to Rapunzel and Flynn’s wedding, and we extend it a little into how the shipwreck explored by Ariel, was actually that of their parents.</p>

                        <h3 itemprop="name">10 Shocking Facts You Didn't Know About The Minions</h3>
                        <p>The Minions are everywhere these days, thanks to the success of the Despicable Me films and their own solo adventure which hit theatres in 2016. But despite how popular they are, what do audiences really know about them? Aside from the obvious, there’s actually a whole bunch of information out there. For instance, the original minions were designed in part with the Jawas from Star Wars and the Oompa Loompas from Willy Wonka in mind. But that was after they decided to scrap the orc design. Yup, Minions were originally going to look more like an orc out of Warcraft or the Lord of the Rings films. The Minions have their own evil counterparts too, who are quite literally on the other side of the color spectrum. Unlike original Minions, which evolved over time from a single celled organism, the purple minions were engineered to do their minion duties without fail. Oh, and be bad guys while they’re at it. There are actually 10400 different minions on the poster for Despicable Me 2, all of them unique. That’s a lot of unique variations. But the method behind making them is actually pretty easy thanks to the help of some pre-determined templates. That’s why some Minions look so alike but in actuality, none of them are 100% the same. Oh-and the Minions can actually survive in space. Apparently, their antics would put them in so much harm that they needed to ensure the survival of their species, even in the vacuum of space.</p>

                        <p>Everyone loves a good Nick show. Whether you grew up watching, enjoy current programming, or have gone back to see the classics, a great Nicktoon is truly enjoyable. With hours and hours of Nick content, fans of the show have had plenty of time to come up with some pretty crazy theories over the years. Watch to see theories based on your favorite Nick shows including SpongeBob Squarepants, the Rugrats, and iCarly.</p>
                        <p>The show Drake and Josh helped launch TeenNick and is still really popular in re-runs today. But was the show actually a reality show set within the Nick universe?! Drake and Josh also featured a character known as Crazy Steve. He may have actually kidnapped Carly and brought her to Seattle, Washington. Speaking of iCarly, Freddie Benson never had a father on the show, but could his father actually have been a bee from the Bee Movie?! SpongeBob Squarepants has many different theories including ones about the origin of the Krusty Krab, the way Bikini Bottom formed, and connections to the seven deadly sins. Rocko’s Modern Life may have set out to be the most perverted show in Nickelodeon history. Was Chuckie’s real mom someone other than the one they showed and how would she connect to Tommy?! Are the Rugrats even real? The widespread theory is easily debunked, but pretty fun to think about. Blue’s Clues is filled with a number of different theories including ones about the character’s intentions and some possible drug problems. Watch to see all the crazy theories related to your favorite Nick shows of all-time!</p>

In fact, your brain has evolved over millennia to release cortisol in stressful situations, inhibiting rational, logical thinking but potentially helping you survive, say, being attacked by a lion. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin thinks there's a way to avoid making critical mistakes in stressful situations, when your thinking becomes clouded — the pre-mortem. "We all are going to fail now and then," he says. "The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be."</p>
